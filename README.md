nw-wiki-app
===========

A simple sample app tom demo the usage of node-webkit.

It provides a simple search feature that would fetch, parse and display a summary from wikipedia. 

You can checkout the video [demo](http://h3manth.com/demo/nw.mov) [Sorry feeling laxy to make a good gif, even with giffy]


__Fetch the dependencies:__

* Install [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and setup an alias to `nw` 

* `git clone https://github.com/hemanth/nw-wiki-app.git && npm install` that would fetch `wikipedai-js`

__Build and run:__ `./bar.sh` that is nothing but `rm app.zip; zip -r app.zip *; nw app.zip`

__That would look like:__
